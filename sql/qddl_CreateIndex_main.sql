This was meant to create simple indexes for the main table, since Access does not allow
to create simple index in CREATE TABLE statement. Several indexes cannot be created
in ALTER TABLE statement either. Therefore indexes are created in 4 lines in VBA
to avoid too extensive a proliferation of queries.
